Depending on the Operating System (Windows, MacOS etc.) you're using, the installation of Python is different. As a reference [this](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) webpage can help you get setup. For this workshop we'll be using Python 3.X and not Python 2.X (the much used, but legacy version of python). If you're ever following tutorials or projects in python be sure you're using the correct version, the change from 2 to 3 means things will not necessarily be compatible between the two. 

### Windows
Here's a [guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/) to getting python set-up on a Windows machine. 

### MacOS
A [guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/) to getting setup with python. For mac this consists of using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a mac package manager, to do all of the installing for us. Once done you should be able to type `python --version` into the terminal to see it installed. 

### Editors
Usually your choice of editor is completely up to you and is just a personal preference. Whilst this is true, even for python, having some form of editor which has some indentation guides might be helpful because they're pretty important in python. Here are some recommendations: 

- [Google's words on setup](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/set-up) - quick and easy for different OSs.
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - a popular choice
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - One editor to rule them all
